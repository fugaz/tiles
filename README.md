# Tiles
A journey into graph coloring.

## Trivia
It is called tiles because when I was repairing home I needed a tool to choose the colors for my bathroom.

## Contents
It uses the [graphstream library](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/) and currently has two colorize strategies implementes (as tests):
- Random. Each tile is colored randomly
- [Welsh-Powell](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Algorithms/Welsh-Powell_1.0/). No contiguous colors, but not the colors distribution I wanted.
